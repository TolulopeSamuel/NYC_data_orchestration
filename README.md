This project integrates the payroll data for the city of New York (NYC) to help with the analysis of its financial resource allocation and also to help with transparency and data accessibility to the public. My task was to create a data pipeline that is dynamic, automated, scalable, and monitored for efficient operation.

The objectivec of the project are as follows:
1. Design a data warehouse for NYC payroll data
2. Develop a scalable and automated ETL Pipeline using Apache Airflow to load the payroll data NYC data warehouse
3. Develop aggregate table(s) in the data warehouse for easy analysis of the key business questions
4. Create a public user with limited privileges to enable public access to the NYC data warehouse
5. Integrate version control and maintain a cloud-hosted repository of your codebase to facilitate collaboration
